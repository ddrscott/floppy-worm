## Abilities

- [ ] ability selection per level
- [x] grab/sticky
      - by default no surface are sticky and can be grabbed.
      - platforms have to be marked to be graspable.
- [x] roll - the worm can stiffen into a wheel and use a thumb stick to control the rotation and other can still used to jump which breaks it out of wheel mode naturally.
